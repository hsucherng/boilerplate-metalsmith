# Metalsmith boilerplate

To set it up:

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Currently tested with NodeJS v6.9.3 and Yarn v1.6.0.
2. Clone this repository onto your machine.
3. Copy the `dev` folder and paste it at where you want your development files to be.
4. Open up the command-line and `cd` into the freshly copied `dev` folder.
5. Run `yarn`. This should install all the required dependencies.
6. Run `node setup` to run a basic initial setup.
7. You are now ready to start building. Run `node build`, then navigate to the full localhost path to view the site.

For more detailed information, check the `README.md` document inside the `dev` folder.
